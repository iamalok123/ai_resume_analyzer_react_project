2. react-router.config.ts -> Configuration Options for react router
3. tsconfig.json -> This file contains the configuration for typescript rules for type safety
4. package.json -> dependencies
5. Dockerfile -> Generated by vite for hosting the app in a docker container
6. .dockerignore , .gitignore -> For not pushing our secrets in github
7. public -> this folder Contains our assets
8. node_modules -> Containing Dependencies
9. .react-router -> containing react router meta data


**⚙️ Tech Stack**

1. React is a popular open‑source JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components and a virtual DOM, enabling efficient, dynamic single-page and native apps.
2. React Router v7 is the go‑to routing library for React apps, offering nested routes, data loaders/actions, error boundaries, code splitting, and SSR support—all with a smooth upgrade path from v6.
3. Puter.com is an advanced, open-source internet operating system designed to be feature-rich, exceptionally fast, and highly extensible. Puter can be used as: A privacy-first personal cloud to keep all your files, apps, and games in one secure place, accessible from anywhere at any time.
4. Puter.js is a tiny client‑side SDK that adds serverless auth, storage, database, and AI (GPT, Claude, DALL·E, OCR…) straight into your browser app—no backend needed and costs borne by users.
5. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.
6. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection for developers, making it ideal for building large-scale applications.
7. Vite is a fast build tool and dev server using native ES modules for instant startup, hot‑module replacement, and Rollup‑powered production builds—perfect for modern web development.
8. Zustand is a minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.




**🔋 Features**

👉 Easy & convenient auth: Handle authentication entirely in the browser using Puter.js—no backend or setup required.
👉 Resume upload & storage: Let users upload and store all their resumes in one place, safely and reliably.
👉 AI resume matching: Provide a job listing and get an ATS score with custom feedback tailored to each resume.
